### Hello World 👋

<h2 align="left">I'm Joshua, a software developer with over 5 years of experience.</h2>

I enjoy building fast, reliable, and elegant applications across mobile, web, backend, and ML-driven systems.
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on a badminton court or listening to reggae and classical music. 😊

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

I’m currently applying machine learning to optical-fiber security by developing models that analyze the State of Polarization (SoP) in fiber-optic networks.
By learning the natural polarization dynamics of the fiber, my models identify subtle irregularities that signal disturbances, tampering, or emerging physical degradation—providing real-time anomaly detection for underground optical-fiber infrastructure.
